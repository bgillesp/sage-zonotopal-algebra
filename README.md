# sage-zonotopal-algebra

SageMath library to compute zonotopal algebra spaces as in [Holtz-Ron 2011] and related literature.  Currently implements all zonotopal spaces for the classical central, external, and internal settings, including a new algorithm for computing the canonical D-space basis polynomials of [Lenz 2016].
